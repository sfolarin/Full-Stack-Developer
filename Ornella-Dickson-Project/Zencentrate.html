            <p>That pain has probably caused you to hold relationships at arm's length or created a pattern of unhealthy attachments. Your self-talk might be negative due to what others have said about you in the past.</p>

            <p>Our past affects NOT just our emotions but also our nervous system. That's why we feel the knot in our chest, overwhelming stress and low mood when our thoughts are triggered. Understanding, then resolving both our emotions and physiological responses helps us react differently. Together we heal the root of your unresolved emotions, teaching you to release it and rebalance your mind, emotions and nervous system.</p>
